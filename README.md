# Ubisoft NEXT 2024-2025 Submission

A 3D, networked, multi-player game built entirely using 2D sprites!

Using A BSP tree for back-to-front polygon order and a software rasterizer for dynamic objects, this project renders a 3D scene with only 2D primitives.

This project was started in April 2024, on the train home from the awards ceremony where I came second. 
I have never put as much effort into anything in my life as this project, and the amount I learned during its development is impossible for me to describe.
