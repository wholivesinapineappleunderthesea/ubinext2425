# Ubisoft NEXT 2024-2025 Submission

A 3D, networked, multi-player game built entirely using 2D sprites!

Using A BSP tree for back-to-front polygon order and a software rasterizer for dynamic objects, this project renders a 3D scene with only 2D primitives.

This project was started in April 2024, on the train home from the awards ceremony where I came second. 
I have never put as much effort into anything in my life as this project, and the amount I learned during its development is impossible to describe.

The theme for this year's competition was Minigolf. I decided to spin it a bit, turning it into a PvP nightmare in which you throw golf clubs and golf balls at your opponents.

There's so much more I'd have loved to do for this project, but I have already sunken nearly a thousand hours into it... I need to get back to my final Capstone project for College and thus I have decided to call it quits here.
